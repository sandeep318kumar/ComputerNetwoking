A process P1 has to create a message queue and places several messages on the queue for processes P2 (type as 2 ) and P3 ( type as 3 ) 
and inquire about the state of the queue with msgctl(), 
and prints the many details of the message queue. 
Now Process P2 and P3 will read few of their messages. 
Now again process P1 has to inquire about the state of the queue with msgctl(), 
and prints the many details of the message queue. Next Process P1 has to do the below: 
It has to use msgctl() to alter (change ) a message on the queue. 
Something like it mayhavv eto change the text of a message. 
And check whether the change has occurred by printing all the messages of the queue without msgrcv().
P has to use msgctl() to delete a message from the queue, 
then print all the messages of the queue to check whether a message has been deleted. 
Note that the message queue contents should not be changed after printing all the messages by using msgctl().
